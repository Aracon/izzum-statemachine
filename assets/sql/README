- postgresql.sql : a full implementation of a posgresql backend which the izzum\statemachine\persistence\PDO can use.
- mysql.sql : a full implementation of a mysql backend which the izzum\statemachine\persistence\PDO can use.
- sqlite.sql : a full implementation of a sqlite backend which the izzum\statemachine\persistence\PDO can use.

- all sql implementations in these files can do 2 things:
	1. store the configuration for machines, states and transitions (can be loaded)
	2. store the state data (can store current states and history)
	
	It's important to realize that the concepts of loading configurations and storing state can be mixed with
	different loaders (like XML, JSON, PDO, Redis or just from within php code)
	and with different persistence adapters (like PDO, Redis, Session, Memory).
	
	This is easily done via the izzum\statemachine\utils\ReaderWriterDelegator class which accepts both a loader (reader) 
	and an adapter (writer) to delegate to.
	
	again: loading of configuration and storing state data/history can be viewed as 2 seperate things.

- schema.json contains a valid json schema definition which the izzum\statemachine\loader\JSON needs to build the correct transitions.
- it can be used to load json from a file and to load a json string from a redis server (see JSON and Redis classes)
- use http://jsonschemalint.com/draft4/# to validate your json against this schema.
- http://json-schema.org/ for the schema specification format
- example.json contains a valid example which validates against the schema and is used in the unittests for the JSON loader and the Redis adapter.

When using a json file to read configuration data from, you still would want
to use a persistence adapter to store/write the state and transition history data.

That can be achieved with one of adapters (like PDO, Session, Memory, Redis) in 
combination with the izzum\statemachine\utils\ReaderWriterDelegator class which accepts both a loader (reader) 
and an adapter (writer) to delegate to.

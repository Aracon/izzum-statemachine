MongoDB is an open-source document database (nosql)

The MongoDB persistence adapter can be used and configured for your mongo instances.
It uses a php basis extension (module). 

the MongoDB implementation for a backend persistence adapter is in izzum\statemachine\persistence\MongoDB
See that file's comments for more information on how to use it and where to find more information.
a screenshot is present in this directory that contains a view on the data stored.


to import a statemachine configuration, use a JSON string according to the JSON schema in 'assets/json'
and import it using the mongoimport tool:
mongoimport --db izzum --collection configuration --drop --file <path-to>/izzum/vendor/rolfvreijdenberger/izzum-statemachine/assets/json/example.json

More information can be found in the MongoDB adapters' comments.

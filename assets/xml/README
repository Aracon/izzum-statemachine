- schema.xsd contains a valid xml schema definition which the izzum\statemachine\loader\XML needs to build the correct transitions.
- use http://www.freeformatter.com/xml-validator-xsd.html to validate your xml against this schema
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_(W3C)
- example.xml contains a valid example which validates against the schema.

When using an xml file to read configuration data from, you still would want
to use a persistence adapter to store/write the state and transition history data.

That can be achieved with one of adapters (like PDO, Session, Memory, Redis) in 
combination with the izzum\statemachine\utils\ReaderWriterDelegator class which accepts both a loader (reader) 
and an adapter (writer) to delegate to.

see also tests/loader/XMLTest.php for examples of how to use it.

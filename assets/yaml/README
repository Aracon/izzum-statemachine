example.yaml contains a valid example for the configuration of two statemachines

At the moment there is no YAML loader but it should be easy to create one with the help of the Symfony YAML parser.
Because the izzum library does not depend on any libraries, I decided not to introduce a dependency of this project on the YAML parser

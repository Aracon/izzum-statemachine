https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML

example.yaml contains a valid example for the configuration of two statemachines

The YAML loader uses the php module (a php basic extension) http://pecl.php.net/package/yaml version 1.2 for 
which the documentation about installation and configuration can be found at https://php.net/manual/en/book.yaml.php. 
The module needs to be installed to be able to work with the YAML loader.


Because the izzum library does not depend on any other php libraries, I decided not to introduce a 
dependency of this project on the YAML parser by Symfony but it should be easy to create one with 
the help of the Symfony YAML parser or any other php parser you'd want to use.


When using a yaml file to read configuration data from, you still would want
to use a persistence adapter to store/write the state and transition history data.

That can be achieved with one of adapters (like PDO, Session, Memory, Redis, MongDB) in 
combination with the izzum\statemachine\utils\ReaderWriterDelegator class which accepts both a loader (reader) 
and an adapter (writer) to delegate to.
Alternatively, you could subclass one of the persistence adapters and override the 'load' method to
delegate the loading to the YAML loader.
